## Code Overview

The code in `DV_project.ipynb` is a Dash application that visualizes data scientist salaries. It uses Plotly for creating interactive plots. The application has a sidebar for navigation and three main sections answering different questions about data scientist salaries. The sections are:

1. Which job should I choose?
2. Which country or company is more convenient?
3. What about Smart working?

Each section contains plots that allow users to explore the data in different ways. The application also includes a callback function that updates the plots based on user input.
